## Profile

7 years of Rust development, 5 years of blockchain core development, and 1 year of AI research and application experience. Actively engaged in the Polkadot ecosystem with end-to-end expertise from protocol design, cross-chain bridge implementation, to mainnet operations. Significant influence in the open-source community with multiple widely adopted Rust libraries. Recently focused on applying AI Agents in Web3 intelligence and data systems.

## Key Achievements

* **Polkadot Fellowship Member** (ecosystem technical contributor)
* **Polkadot Stack Exchange Moderator**, Top 1–3 for 3 consecutive years: [profile](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/users/251/aurexav)
* Independently developed and maintained a stable public blockchain: [Darwinia](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia)
* Developed the first **Ethereum↔Substrate Crosschain Bridge** in the Polkadot ecosystem
* Led seamless migration from **Solochain → Parachain** (mainnet upgrade)
* Independently completed **3 W3F Grants**: [projects index](https://github.com/hack-ink)
* Created the first Rust miner for **Bitcoin Atomicals Protocol**, achieving multi-fold efficiency gains; community GPU miner was built upon it: [atomicalsir](https://github.com/hack-ink/atomicalsir)
* Rust array encoding library [array-bytes](https://github.com/hack-ink/array-bytes): used by 9000+ projects, 8,000,000+ downloads
* Rust string escaping library [unescaper](https://github.com/hack-ink/unescaper): used by 2000+ projects, 6,000,000+ downloads; adopted by OpenZeppelin, Stackware, GreptimeDB, probe-rs, serialport
* **AI Agentic Crypto/DeFi Intelligence System**: autonomous intelligence gathering and analysis from on-chain and exchange data sources (self-developed)
